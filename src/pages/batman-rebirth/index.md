# Batman - Rebirth

Batman finds himself against an unusual foe—a calendar man with the ability to speed through the seasons. There's a deadly surprise headed to Gotham… and as Bruce tries to stop the impending catastrophe, he seeks out a young Duke Thomas to present him with a surprising offer.

Alfred finds himself cleaning the garden until Duke Thomas comes into Wayne Manor, asking about the job offer.

Monday, spring: Batman fights the Calendar Man, who is about to release venomous spores into the air. After knocking Calendar Man unconscious, Batman asks Jim for a status report. Jim replies the spores have already leaked into the air. Batman then sets his suit to release an electrical discharge, burning all the spores.

Tuesday, summer: Bruce is doing exercise on the Wayne Enterprises helipad when Lucius gives him the good news: the Wayne fortune is once again his. Bruce and Lucius both remark that Lucius have saved the Wayne fortune one too many times. Lucius also tells Bruce of a conversation he had with Bruce’s father, about trying to convince him to focus on his company and stop being a doctor because no matter what he did, people wouldn’t stop getting sick. Thomas replied that even sick people needed someone to believe they can get better.
